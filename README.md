# Stock Analyser
There are two types of stock analysis: Fundamental and Technical.
I usually use https://in.tradingview.com/ for techinal and https://www.screener.in/ for fundamental analysis.
But there are so many stocks listed in the market that the analysis for different stocks using multiple tools becomes clumsy.

Created a solution for my personal use where I can select stocks from a list and open stock anaylsis on tool of my choice.
I can even provide my credentials that I use to log into the selected tool so that when it loads the stocks, my personalizations I made on the tool are loaded as well.

Steps to run the tool:

1) git clone
2) npm install
3) npm start
